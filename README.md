## ⚠️ WARNING: Prepare to be Unwhelmed

Welcome to the digital monument to my coding journey. Yes, another portfolio. I know, I know. This repository is the source code for my "Professional" site, which is basically an overly complicated static page designed to convince you that I'm worth a shockingly high salary.

It's everything you've come to expect from a modern developer portfolio: slightly over-engineered, suspiciously clean, and guaranteed to be running a deprecated version of a package somewhere.

## 🌟 The Features (or: Why I Spent Two Weeks On This Instead Of Sleeping)

  * **It loads.** Seriously. It actually loads fast. That’s a feature now. Next.js handles the speed; I handle the lack of content.
  * **Mobile-Friendly:** If you can view the internet on your phone, you can view this. It’s truly responsive to the concept of a screen existing.
  * **The *Sacrifice* Tab:** This is where I put projects that look polished, but weren't actually complex enough to make me cry. The sweet spot of impressive-but-low-effort.
  * **See that `portfolio.zip` file?** Yeah. Don't ask. I'm sure there was a solid reason for committing a compressed archive, probably related to a deadline or a particularly bad cup of coffee.

## 🛠️ The Technology Stack (Read: Things I Copy-Pasted)

This groundbreaking site is powered by the following industry-standard buzzwords:

  * [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) (The "App Router" flavor, because I enjoy figuring out new ways to be confused.)
  * [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) (The foundation of *all* modern web apps, and my biggest source of "Why is this re-rendering?" questions.)
  * **TypeScript.** I use it to feel superior and also to convert my runtime errors into build-time errors, which is technically progress, but still annoying.
  * **CSS** (Yes, regular CSS. I'm a rebel, or perhaps just too lazy to set up Tailwind correctly.)

## 🚀 Getting Started (If you absolutely must)

If you're bored, please clone this. If you find a bug, please raise an issue. If you find a spelling mistake, please fix it yourself. I'm tired.

### 1\. The Ritual

You need Node.js. If you don't, you're not in the target demographic, and this README is already too advanced for you.

```bash
# Clone this bad boy down
git clone https://github.com/pintoraj/Pinto-Portfolio.git

# Navigate to the epicenter of potential
cd Pinto-Portfolio
```

### 2\. The Incantation

Pick your package manager. They all do the same thing:

```bash
npm install 
# or 
yarn 
# or 
pnpm install
# or 
bun install 
```

### 3\. The Grand Opening

Run the development server and behold the magic:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) in your browser. If it doesn't work immediately, that's just a feature, not a bug. It's preparing you for the realities of software development.

### **P.S. (Recruiters only):**

I am indeed a "self-starter" who is "passionate about technology," and yes, my greatest weakness is that "I sometimes work too hard." Now, about that salary...

For Serious Inquiries: If you managed to read this far and are still interested in hiring me, please use the contact details found in my GitHub profile or on the website itself. I keep my professional channels separate from my public repositories because I'm pretending to be organized. Do not send DMs here.

### **📢 The Final, Completely Unnecessary Announcement:**
You can actually view this masterpiece live at <a href="https://pintoraj.in" target="_blank">pintoraj.in</a>. Yes, I spent actual money on that domain. That should tell you everything you need to know about my commitment to... something.
